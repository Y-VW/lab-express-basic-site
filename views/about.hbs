        Holland resides in Kingston upon Thames in London, near the house of his parents and younger brothers. He has a blue Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Tessa. When he was seven, Holland was diagnosed with dyslexia. In June 2015, Holland was seen wearing the uniform of the English football club Arsenal F.C. in a Daily Mirror article, which led many people to speculate that he was a fan of the club. However, in a September 2019 video produced by GQ magazine, and released on that publication's YouTube channel, Holland stated that this was not the case.
        Along with his three younger brothers, Holland sponsors The Brothers Trust, a UK Registered Charity that raises money for various charitable causes.
        Holland publicly credits his father, comedian and writer Dominic Holland, for keeping his Spider-Man fame from "getting to his head."
        Holland is close friends with MCU co-star Robert Downey Jr., who he claims 'took me under his wing.'
